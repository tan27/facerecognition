## Face Recognition App 🤦‍♀️
  
> An app that uses user submitted url photos and detects faces. After registering, the user will receive a point towards every submitted image, updated and saved within their profile.
</p>

## Development Focus
- Building registration/sign-up forms and general foundation of app from scratch to solidify React knowledge.
- Utilize [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/) for detecting facial features in images submitted through url.
- Use React class components and this.state & this.setState to manage state.
- Include back-end, utilizing Rest APIs and PostgreSQL to manage user data.
- Utilize [tsParticles](https://particles.js.org/) and individual css files for styling.
- Deploy to Heroku.

## Development Improvement
- [ ] Feature: Detect multiple faces.
- [ ] Clean-up components with repeated code.
